# Reinforcemtn Learning

### What is RL?

Reinforcement learning can be summarized as an agent optimizing it's actions to maximize its reward i.e. experiences in, action-policy that maximizes rewards out. An A/B test can be considered a simple form reinforcement learning. What makes a full reinforcement learning more complicated is that every action transpors the agent to a new "state" in which a simlar action my have totally different rewards. It can be summarized in the following equstion:

### Stages of RL
* A/B Test
* Bandits
* Full Reinforcement Learning

### Concepts
* Exploration versus Exploitation
* Markov Decision Process (MDP)
* Reward
* Bellmans Equations
* On-Policy versus Off-Policy Learning
* Function Approixmators
* The Deadly Triad

### Methods
* Monte Carlo Estimation
* Q-Learning
* TD-Lambda
* SARSA
* Dyno
* DQN

### Applications
* Games
* Website Optimzation
* Finance
* Self-Driving Cars

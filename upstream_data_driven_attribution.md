(in-progress)

This paper addresses the issue of multi-touch attribution (MTA). MTA is slight different than media mix modeling (MMM) in that it aims to model ROAS based on user level click/impression data versus channel level spend data. 

Position Based Attribution (PBA): last-click, first-click, linear, time-decay. 
Data-Driven Attribution (DDA): Often proprietary, but based on leave-one out modeling.
Paper Solution: UDDA

Uses simulation to measure/stress test. 

Main agrument: impression clicks impact downstreasm actions, which DDA doesn't take into account.
